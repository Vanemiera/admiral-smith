"hmm maybe something along the lines of "Welcome back to the barracks soldier" ?"
"Maybe it should say, if possable, "So <name here> Who do you want to fight today?" idk man"
"I usually greet new recruits in character when in-game, so usually I'll use stuff from the
 intro-movie: "Congratulations on having made the most important decision of your life!
 The most elite and humanitarian ambassadors of Freedom, Democracy and the Super-Earth
 way of life are proud to welcome you to their ranks and look forward to serve alongside
 you, as well as drink Liber-Tea!""
