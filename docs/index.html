        This is the bot for the <a href="https://discord.gg/HELLDIVERS">
        Helldivers Discord server</a>. Made to handle role-assignment and other
        tasks. For suggestions, feel free to post in #suggestion-box.
      </p>
      <h2 class="gothic" id="usage"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
      <p class="gothic">
        Commands can be used in any chat of the Helldivers server.
        Square brackets signify available subcommands.
        For example the platform command can be used by either typing "!platform pc"
        or "!platform psn".
      </p>
      <h2 class="gothic" id="commands"><a href="#commands">Commands</a></h2>
      <h3 class="gothic" id="platform"><a href="#platform">!platform [ pc | psn | pc+psn ]</a></h3>
      <p class="gothic">
        Assigns you one of the platform roles. The roles will allow you to participate
        in the lfg channels. Search for people should be done there. Only one
        role can be assigned at once. If you own the game on both platforms,
        use pc+psn.
      </p>
      <h3 class="gothic" id="lfg"><a href="#lfg">!lfg [ join | leave ]</a></h3>
      <p class="gothic">
        Assigns you the LFG role and removes it. Members with the LFG role can
        be pinged with "@LFG". Of course notifications for mentions need to be
        turned on for this to work.
